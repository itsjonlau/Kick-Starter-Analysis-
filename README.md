# Kick-Starter-Analysis-
module 1

Overview. 
The purpose of this project was to help Louise understand what the impact play fundraising to launch date. 

Analysis and Challenges 
we were required to use numerous functions such as sum(), Countifs() and etc  in order to determine the results displayed in the charts of the excel file. 
these functions have allowed us to draw different types of data such as number of Failed, Canceled, Succesfull project, and then obtaining the Percentage of those fundraisers as well. 

Challenges
The hardest challenge faced was sorting throug the correct pivot tables, creatting the correct visualization based on what was asked, and sorting through the relationships between the data set . 

Results 
From the chart of "out comes based on goal" , we can conclude  that plays that require a higher fund raising goal were likely to fail compared to the lower $ goal. 
From the chart of "outcomes based on launch date" we can see that theres a significantly higher success rate of campaigns based on the launch date of the month of may. 

Some other charts to consider to further the analysis would be a Scatter graph, Line graphs, box plots  and pie graphs
